I am CÃ©sar Guerra-Solano, a [Stamps Scholar](https://www.stampsscholars.org/) and Frederick Honors Student at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in computer science and computational biology. I am most interested in researching the intersection of computer science, neuroscience, and linguistics. Finding how to apply computer science to different fields is what keeps me going.

Starting in January 2023, I will be researching pain behaviors as a member of the [Taylor Lab](https://www.taylorlab.anes.pitt.edu/), working with Adam Brandner. I have previously [researched implicit bias in literature](https://www.bu.edu/summer/files/2022/02/Guerra-Solano-Cesar-RISE-Poster-2021.pdf) under Dr. Derry Wijaya at Boston University as a member of the RISE program.

I find genuine enjoyment in teaching others. Starting in January 2023, I will be a UTA for CMPINF 0010: Big Ideas in Computing & Information. I will also be continuing involvement in Pitt SEMFS, creating and presenting STEM lessons to elementary students, along with tutoring.

I currently intern for Reprise Financial as a Credit/Underwriting Intern. I work implementing large-scale models to identify potential customers through mail offers. I also work to adapt the model-building process to AWS, utilizing Amazon SageMaker and S3 Buckets for data storage.
